Networks are often complex and contain a lot of information. In some cases, networks are weighted, where the edge weights might capture the strength, capacity, intensity, or frequency of the link between two nodes (e.g., the strength of a friendship). In other cases, networks may be very dense (e.g., everyone is friends). Weighted and dense networks can be difficult to analyze and visualize. In such cases, it is often helpful to focus on the network's _backbone_, which is an unweighted network that contains only the most "important" links. The {**backbone**} package implements a variety of backbone extraction models that are designed for different types of networks (weighted, unweighted) and define what makes an edge "important" in different ways.
