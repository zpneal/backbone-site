The **backbone** package is available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=backbone) and can be installed from the **R** console by typing `install.packages("backbone")`. 

Once the **backbone** package is installed, you can:
* load it using `library(backbone)`
* view documentation using `?backbone`
* view a detailed introduction using `vignette("backbone")`

You can install the _development_ version of backbone from GitHub using `devtools::install_github("zpneal/backbone", ref = "devel", build_vignettes = TRUE)`. The functions in the development function are documented and have undergone various levels of preliminary testing, so they should all work, but there are no guarantees.
